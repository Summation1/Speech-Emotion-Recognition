# Speech Emotion Recognition System 🎙️

This project is a **Speech Emotion Recognition System** that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify human emotions such as **happy, sad, neutral, angry**, and more based on voice inputs. It leverages pre-trained models and provides the ability to evaluate custom audio files for emotion detection.

## Features 🚀

- **Emotion Detection**: Accurately detects emotions from audio recordings.
- **Pre-trained Model**: A pre-trained CNN model included for quick and efficient predictions.
- **Custom Testing**: Users can test custom audio inputs in `.wav` format.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays the accuracy of the model on the test dataset.
